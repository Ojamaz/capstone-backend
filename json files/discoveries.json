    "year": "1970",
    "description": "A quantum heterostructure is a heterostructure in a substrate (usually a semiconductor material), where size restricts the movements of the charge carriers forcing them into a quantum confinement. This leads to the formation of a set of discrete energy levels at which the carriers can exist. Quantum heterostructures have sharper density of states than structures of more conventional sizes.",

    "description": "The Starling principle holds that fluid movement across a semi-permeable blood vessel such as a capillary or small venule is determined by the hydrostatic pressures and colloid osmotic pressures (oncotic pressure) on either side of a semipermeable barrier that sieves the filtrate, retarding larger molecules such as proteins from leaving the blood stream.",

    "description": "Body transfer illusion is the illusion of owning either a part of a body or an entire body other than one's own, thus it is sometimes referred to as \"body ownership\" in the research literature. It can be induced experimentally by manipulating the visual perspective of the subject and also supplying visual and sensory signals which correlate to the subject's body.",

    "description": "The germ theory of disease is the currently accepted scientific theory for many diseases. It states that microorganisms known as pathogens or \"germs\" can cause disease. These small organisms, which are too small to be seen without magnification, invade animals, plants, and even bacteria. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause disease.",

At low levels of disturbance, more competitive organisms will push subordinate species to extinction and dominate the ecosystem.",

The model is named for John Hubbard. The Hubbard model states that each electron experiences competing forces: one pushes it to tunnel to neighboring atoms, while the other pushes it away from its neighbors.",
