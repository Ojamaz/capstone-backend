1,Glucosidase,1878,"Glucosidase is an enzyme that promotes the hydrolysis of glucoside bonds in sugar. Glucosidases are located in the duodenum where they break down complex carbohydrates so absorption can occur. Overactivity or deficiency of this enzyme can result in health issues like Gaucher's disease and Pompe disease. In 1878, Wilhelm Kühne (1837–1900) first isolated a sample of the glucosidase enzyme.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucosidase
2,Enzymes,1878,"Enzymes are biological molecules, often complex proteins, that catalyze (speed up) chemical reactions. In the mid-19th century, Louis Pasteur concluded that fermentation was catalyzed by a vital force contained within the yeast cells, a discovery supported by his experiments. The term ""enzyme"" was coined by Friedrich Wöhler and Justus Liebig in the mid-1800s, but it wasn't until 1878 that Wilhelm Kühne officially used the term. However, the first enzyme, diastase, was discovered by Anselme Payen earlier in 1833. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to take place at rates sufficient for life.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzymes
3,Glycoside hydrolase,1833,"Glycoside hydrolases, also known as glucosidase and glycosidases, were first discovered in 1833. They are a type of enzyme that has the ability to hydrolyze the glycosidic bond that holds a glycoside together. These enzymes play a crucial role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, as well as in industrial applications. Glycoside hydrolases are involved in numerous biological pathways, including defense against pathogens, in energy storage, and in the construction, modification, and degradation of bioactive compounds. They are also used in various industrial applications such as biofuel production, laundry detergents, and the synthesis of important aggressive chemicals.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside_hydrolase
4,Alpha-Amylase,1831,"Alpha-amylase is an enzyme that hydrolyses alpha-bonds of large, alpha-linked polysaccharides, such as starch and glycogen, yielding glucose and maltose. It is the major form of amylase found in humans and other mammals. It is also present in seeds containing starch as a food reserve, and is secreted by many fungi. Its discovery took place in 1831 by scientist Anselme Payen.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Amylase
5,Maltose,1872,"Maltose, also known as maltobiose or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed from two units of glucose joined with an α(1→4) bond. It was first discovered by a French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1872. Maltose can typically be found in germinating grains, a process known as malting, and its key role is in brewing and fermentation processes. Notably, it is less sweet than glucose, fructose, or sucrose.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltose
